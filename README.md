Practice for the classic Kernighan &amp; Ritchie book

Fun going through the classic book and learning something more low level. My experience is with Java, usually through an ide.
Practicing on the command line, compiling with the clang compiler in FreeBSD is a learning experience.

It's fun seeing the influence of C on Java, and where they differ!
